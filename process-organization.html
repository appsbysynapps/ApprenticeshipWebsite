                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <h4>Initial Consultations</h4>
                        <p> 
                            At an in-person, phone, or Skype/Google Hangouts meeting, we'll discuss, delineate, and clarify your specific needs. Our first goal is to help you, so we'll be sure to show you all of your options during the initial meeting or followup discussions. You'll also get a chance to meet the developers assigned to building your site; we guarantee that at least one senior developer will be helping you create your site. If you've never had experience with web development, don't worry - we'll guide you through the entire process!
                        </p>
                        <h4>Building the Site</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can expect our team of developers to be working as hard as they can on your website over the period of the next few weeks. All their code should be viewable by you at any time online. If you'd prefer, they'll send weekly email updates, and if you ever want to touch base with them, just send an email! Feel free to schedule more meetings to discuss your needs or learn more about web development at no extra cost.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Final Steps </h4>
                        <p>
                            We want to make sure each and every one of our customers is as happy as they should be. The project should conclude with our developers showing you the completed site, along with how it looks on mobile and tablet devices. Further edits can be made at any time, and no matter how long after the site was created, feel free to reach out to the Apprenticeship Program for any assistance you might require.
                        </p>

                                <p> Pricing is absolutely flexible, and starts from just<span style="font-weight:bold">$100</span>! This price is vastly undercuts most freelance web developers. Our fee depends on the complexity of the project and financial need of the client organization. In the most common scenario, we will develop a fully responsive frontend website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for $100 upfront while still literally saving you <span style="font-weight:bold">hundreds of dollars</span> in just a few years. </p>
