                        <h3>The Mission</h3>
                        <p> 
                            For the past few years, we have seen a push for computer science education in America. Everyone, especially teenagers currently in high school, are encouraged to learn how to code - and for good reason. The projected average annual job openings for computer science far outpace annual degrees earned in the field. 52% of all STEM job openings from 2010-2020 will be in the field of computing and mathematics. Fewer than 20 percent of AP Computer Science students are women. Fewer than 10% are Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino. <a href="http://csedweek.org/resource_kit/blurbs" target="_blank"> (CSEdWeek) </a> The field of computer science offers an unprecedented opportunity to anyone with access to a computer, an idea, and perseverance to make it in the industry. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet, just as increased participation and inclusivity become the most urgent priorities in computer science today, we continue to waste the talent of millions of high schoolers across the nation. While there are many great resources for high schoolers to learn to code, like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> or <a href="http://code.org/learn" target="_blank">Code.org</a>, high school students subsequently have no place to apply their skills. Companies won't hire them because of their ages, and they are left with no real way to enter the web development industry, meet professionals, and hone their craft. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We at the Synapps Apprenticeship Program aim to change all of that. We want students to learn to code - and then apply those skills. Furthermore, in a world where eager startups eye billion-dollar acquisitions and increasing profits, we want to introduce technology as a lever to create positive impacts on the communities in which students live. For minorities and low-income students, creating a website or app for a local business could level the playing field across socioeconomic divisions, expand customer reach and acquisition, and help someone support their family. Moreover, as apprentices, these students joining the program can earn community service hours while gaining the most valuable asset of all: experience and connections. Apprentices will also enjoy benefits like free hosting, development tools, and in-house mentoring from senior developers at Synapps.

                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>The Apprenticeship Program was created in late 2014 by Matthew Sun, Co-Founder and Director of Web &#38; Design at Synapps LLC, as part of the <a href="http://learn-serve.org/learnserve-incubator/" target="_blank">LearnServe Incubator Program</a>. As a student who has faced the exact issues he hopes to solve with the Apprenticeship Program, Matthew has found incredible support and advice in the Apprenticeship Program, especially from his mentor, Darrell Scott. </p>
